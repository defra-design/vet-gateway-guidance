      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"></h2>
      <p>Official Veterinarians (OVs) are private practice veterinarians who are qualified to deliver government-funded statutory testing and other veterinary services on behalf of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a>.</p>
      <p>APHA will authorise any person as an OV who:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is a full member or fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, or approved by the RCVS to practice veterinary medicine for a specified period of time in the UK as an EU national</li>
        <li>holds the appropriate Official Controls Qualification (Veterinary) (OCQ(V))</li>
        <li>is regarded by APHA as suitable for carrying out tasks on behalf of Ministers, taking into account any previous performance as an offical or veterinary surgeon</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        <p>All OVs are authorised under the <a href="">Policy for Authorisation of Official Veterinarians in GB</a>. You must be familiar with this document before becoming an OV and while you're authorised.</p>
      </div>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-become-ov">How to become an OV</h2>
      <p>To become an OV you must <a href="https://improve-ov.com/registration/" class="govuk-link">register with Improve International</a> and complete the relevant OCQ(V) training. Before you do any training you should check which qualification(s) are needed for the work you'll be doing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.improve-ov.com/qualifications/about.php">Learn more about OCQ(V)s at Improve International</a>.</p>
      <p>APHA will grant your OV authorisation when you've completed the training and have met all qualification requirements. If you're a new OV, APHA will then send your official OV stamp with your unique OV number to you by post. You'll need to use your stamp on official documents to certify them.</p>

      <p>Authorisation can take up to 10 working days. You'll be notified by email when it's granted. You must wait until your authorisation is confirmed before starting any OV work.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">OV training costs</h3>
      <p>You or your employer will be responsible for training costs.</p>
      <p>Prospective and current OVs working in Scotland may be eligible to claim a Scottish Government funded code for OCQ(V) - SS and OCQ(V) - TT training.</p>

      
      

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="tb-testing">What to do if you'll be TB testing</h2>
      <p>If you'll be carrying out TB testing you must pass the OCQ(V) - TT theory exam and complete the following steps.</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>You must nominate an Approved Veterinary Supervisor (AVS).</li>
        <li>Your supervisor must the AVS role and appoint at least one deputy.</li>
        <li>You must <a href="sam-register-enrol-v4#how-register-sam">enrol in Sam</a>, APHA's online system for recording TB test results.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>APHA will then grant you conditional authorisation so you can complete a period of practical training and assessment. When this is completed, APHA will grant your full authorisation.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-statutory TB testing in zoos</h3>

      <p>You may not need to complete the OCQ(V) - TT training if you'll be carrying out non-statutory TB testing in zoological conditions. Learn more about <a href="training-tb-zoos-v3">training and requirements for carrying out zoological TB testing</a></p>
      





      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="#maintaining-qualifications-authorisation">Maintaining your qualifications and authorisation</h2>
      <p>Your authorisation will be suspended if you do not maintain your qualification(s). Most qualifications must be revalidated every 4 years. Improve International will send you reminders of your revalidation deadline(s) by email.</p>
      <p>If you do not revalidate by the deadline your authorisation will be suspended and you'll have 6 months to revalidate it before it expires.</p>
      <p>If your authorisation expires you'll need to complete your OV training again.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Extensions and exceptions</h3>
      <p>You can apply for an extension or exception if you cannot complete:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the OCQ(V) revalidation within the specified deadline, or</li>
        <li>the OCQ(V) - TT training requirements within the the period of conditional authorisation</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>Extensions and exceptions can only be given in certain situations. Details can be found in the application form.</p>
      <p><a href="">Apply for an extension or exemption to the training and revalidation requirments</a>.</p>
      <p>If your OCQ(V) - TT authorisation has expired within the past 4 years and you want to be reauthorised, you can apply to waive the requirement to repeat the practical training and assessment for reauthorisation. Evidence of any TB audit carried out in the past 4 years must be provided with your application.</p>






      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="ov-records" style="margin-top: 30px">Maintaining your OV records</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for making sure all your details recorded on Improve International are correct.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're registered on Sam and need to change your name or transfer to another practice</h3>
      <p>To change your details on Sam you must first update your Improve International account information. You must then complete:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the <a href="">OV57 form for a name change</a>, or</li>
        <li>the <a href="">OV58 form for a practice transfer</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your information will be processed and updated on Sam within 10 working days.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="lost-damaged-stolen-stamp">If you need a replacement stamp</h3>
      <p>If your OV stamp has been lost, damaged or stolen you must <a href="">complete the OV45 form</a> and send it to APHA's OV team. The OV team will send you a replacement stamp within 10 working days of receiving the form.</p>
      <p>If your stamp has been stolen you must report the theft to the police. If you're given a crime reference number you must include it on the OV45 form.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="lost-damaged-stolen-stamp">If your RCVS UK practising membership ends</h3>
      <p>Your OV authorisations will expire if you're no longer a UK practising RCVS member. To become an OV again you'll need to <a href="https://rcvs.org.uk/registration/renew-or-make-changes-to-your-registration/voluntary-removal-and-restoration">reactivate your RCVS membership</a> and contact APHA's OV team to apply for your authorisation to be reinstated.</p>
      <p>If you know that your RCVS membership is about to change (for example, because of parental leave), you can <a href="TR588">apply to suspend your OV authorisation</a> to stop it from expiring.</p>






      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="stop-being-ov">How to stop being an OV</h2>
      <p>If your OV status is no longer required you can either:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="">deregister as an OV</a>, or</li>
        <li>allow your OV authorisation to expire by choosing not to revalidate your qualification(s)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to destroy your official OV stamp</h3>
      <p>When your authorisation ends you must destroy your official OV stamp. You can do this yourself or post it to APHA's OV team to do it for you. If you want to destroy your stamp yourself, you must:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Peel off the rubber containing the unique number.</li>
        <li>Cut the rubber off and dispose of the rubber and number separately.</li>
        <li>Take a picture of the destroyed stamp and email it to CSCOneHealthOVTeam@apha.gov.uk.</li>
      </ol>     






      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Setting up a new practice</h2>
      <p>New practices must <a href="ov-practice-forms">download and complete the new OV practice forms</a>, then return them to APHA by post.      
      <p>After the forms are returned, your local APHA office may decide to inspect your practice. When they have confirmed that your practice can be set up, APHA's OV team will complete the process and notify you. The OV team will ensure that all OV records are created and updated, and that relevant documentation is sent out.</p>

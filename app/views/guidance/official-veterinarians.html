      <p>Official Veterinarians (OVs) are private practice veterinarians who are qualified to deliver government-funded statutory testing and other veterinary services on behalf of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a>.</p>
      <p>APHA will authorise any person as an OV who:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is a full member or fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, or approved by the RCVS to practice veterinary medicine for a specified period of time in the UK as an EU national</li>
        <li>holds the appropriate Official Controls Qualification (Veterinary) (OCQ(V))</li>
        <li>is regarded by APHA as suitable for carrying out tasks on behalf of Ministers, taking into account any previous performance as an OV or convictions for offences under animal health or welfare legislation</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-become-ov">How to become an OV</h2>
      <p>To become an OV you must <a href="https://improve-ov.com/registration/" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">register with Improve International (opens in a new tab)</a> and complete the relevant OCQ(V) training. Before you do any training you should check if it's required for the work you'll be doing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.improve-ov.com/qualifications/about.php">Learn more about OCQ(V)s at Improve International (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
      <p>APHA will grant your OV authorisation when you have completed the training. Authorisation can take up to 10 working days. You will be notified by email when it has been granted. APHA will then send your official OV stamp to you by post.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">OV training costs</h3>
      <p>You or your employer will be responsible for training costs.</p>
      <p>Prospective and current OVs working in Scotland may be eligible to claim a Scottish Government funded code for OCQ(V) - SS and OCQ(V) - TT training.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Maintaining your qualification</h3>
      <p>Your authorisation will be suspended if you do not maintain your qualification(s). Most OVs can do this by revalidating it every 4 years. If your qualification is suspended you will have 6 months to revalidate it before it expires. </p>
      <p>If your qualification expires you will need to complete your OV training again.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Setting up a new practice</h3>
      <p>New practices must <a href="ov-practice-forms">download and complete the new OV practice forms</a>, then return them to APHA by post.      
      <p>After the forms have been returned your local APHA office may wish to inspect your practice. When it is confirmed that your practice can be set up, APHA's OV team will complete the set up process and notify you. The OV team will ensure that all OV records are created and updated, and that relevant documentation is sent out.</p>

      

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="tb-testing">What to do if you will be TB testing</h2>
      <p>If you will be carrying out TB testing you should authorise under the OCQ(V) - TT qualification. You do not need to do this for non-statutory TB testing in zoological conditions.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-become-ov">Access to Sam</h3>
      <p>Sam is APHA's system for recording TB test results online. All OVs who will be carrying out TB tests must <a href="sam">enrol in Sam</a>.</p>
      <p>The practice you test for must also have enrolled in Sam and completed the <a href="#">OVb37 Sam declaration form</a>.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="ov-records" style="margin-top: 30px">Maintaining your OV records</h2>
      <p>APHA's OV team will create and update OV records for your practice, and ensure that all relevant documentation is issued.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need to change your name or transfer to another practice</h3>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Update your Improve International account information.</li>
        <li>Complete the OV57 form for a name change or the OV58 form for a practice transfer.</li>

      </ol>
      <p>Your information will be processed within 10 working days. Updated certificates can be found on Improve International.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="lost-damaged-stolen-stamp">If you need a replacement stamp</h3>
      <p>If your stamp has been lost or damaged, complete the OV45 form and send it to APHA's OV team by post. You will need a lost property number for a stamp that has been lost.</p>
      <p>If your stamp has been stolen you must report the theft and get a crime reference number before contacting the OV team. </p>
      <p>The OV team will issue a replacement stamp within 10 working days.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="stop-being-ov">Deregister as an OV</h2>
      <p>If your OV status is no longer required you must complete the OV55 form and send it to APHA's OV team. Your information will be processed within 10 working days.</p>
      <p>After you have deregistered as an OV your official stamp must be destroyed.</p>

      <p>Official Veterinarians (OVs) are private practice veterinarians who are qualified to deliver government-funded statutory testing and other veterinarian services on behalf of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-become-ov">How to become an OV</h2>
      <p>To become an OV you must <a href="https://improve-ov.com/registration/">register with Improve International</a> and complete the relevant Official Controls Qualification (Veterinary) training.</p>



      <!-- NEEDS CHECKING -->

      <p>If you were authorised as an OV or Local Veterinary Inspector (LVI) before 2014, you may be able to apply for grandfather rights in the corresponding OCQ(V)s.</p>

      


      <p><a href="https://www.improve-ov.com/qualifications/about.php">Learn more about the different OV qualifications at Improve International</a>.</p>

      <p>APHA will grant your OV authorisation when you have completed the training. Authorisation can take up to 10 working days. You will be notified by email when it has been granted. APHA will then send your stamp to you.</p>



      <!-- NEEDS CHECKING -->

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">OV training costs</h3>

      <p>You or your employer will be responsible for training costs. Prospective and current OVs working in Scotland may be eligible to claim a Scottish Government funded code for OCQ(V) - SS and OCQ(V) - TT training.</p>




      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Maintaining your qualification</h3>

      <p>Most OVs will need to maintain their qualification by revalidating it every 4 years.</p>

      <p>If you do not maintain your qualification, your authorisation will be suspended. You will then have 6 months to revalidate the qualification. If you do not revalidate within 6 months, the authorisation will expire and you will need to complete the full training course to become an authorised OV again.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="stop-being-ov">What to do if you no longer need to be an OV</h3>

      <p>If your OV status is no longer required, complete the OV55 form and send it to APHA's OV team. Your information will be processed within 10 working days.</p>

      <!-- <p><i>What happens after OV55 has been processed</i></p> -->


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="new-practice">Setting up a new practice</h2>

      <p>New practices should <a href="ov-practice-forms">download and complete the new OV practice forms</a>, then return them to APHA by post. <!-- These include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Details of suppliers A/AP201</li>
        <li>General procedures for Official Veterinarians, His Majesty's customs and excise conditions on OV fees self-billing invoicing systems - OV10</li>
        <li>General procedures for Official Veterinarians, payment of OV fees OV09</li>
        <li>Confidentiality agreement</li>
      </ul> -->

      <p>If your practice will be TB testing you must also  complete the Sam declaration form OVb37</p>

      <p>After the forms have been returned your local APHA office may wish to inspect your practice. When it is confirmed that your practice can be set up, APHA's OV team will complete the set up process and notify you. The OV team will ensure that all OV records are created and updated, and that relevant documentation is sent out.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What to do if your practice will be TB testing</h3>

      <!-- This needs checking re registration for individuals and practices -->

      <!-- This section is all from VG and needs rewriting -->

      <p>Sam is APHA's system for recording the reigstration of livestock species, work management and bovine tuberculosis (bTB). All new OVs and Approved Tuberculin Testers (ATTs) must register on Sam to submit TB test results.</p>

      <p>The practice that you test for must be registered on Sam in order for you to be able to submit your TB tests results.</p>

      <p>If you are becoming an ATT, when you complete your ATT theory training you will be prompted to register on Sam. Your authorisation as an ATT will not be granted until this is complete.</p>

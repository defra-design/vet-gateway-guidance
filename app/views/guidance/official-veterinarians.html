      <p>Official Veterinarians (OVs) are private practice veterinarians who are qualified to deliver government-funded statutory testing and other veterinarian services on behalf of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-become-ov">How to become an OV</h2>
      <p>To become an OV you must <a href="https://improve-ov.com/registration/">register with Improve International</a> and complete the relevant Official Controls Qualification (Veterinary) training.</p>

      <p>There are specific <a href="tb-testing-zoos">training requirements and exceptions for veterinary surgeons carrying out TB testing</a>.</p>



      <!-- NEEDS CHECKING -->

      <p>If you were authorised as an OV or Local Veterinary Inspector (LVI) before 2014, you may be able to apply for grandfather rights in the corresponding OCQ(V)s.</p>

      


      <p><a href="https://www.improve-ov.com/qualifications/about.php">Learn more about the different OV qualifications at Improve International</a>.</p>

      <p>APHA will grant your OV authorisation when you have completed the training. Authorisation can take up to 10 working days. You will be notified by email when it has been granted. APHA will then send your stamp to you.</p>



      <!-- NEEDS CHECKING -->

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">OV training costs</h3>

      <p>You or your employer will be responsible for training costs. Prospective and current OVs working in Scotland may be eligible to claim a Scottish Government funded code for OCQ(V) - SS and OCQ(V) - TT training.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Maintaining your qualification</h3>


      <!-- IS IT THAT MOST OVs CAN REVALIDATE EVERY 4 YEARS OR THAT MOST QUALIFICATIONS WILL BE SUSPENDED IF NOT MAINTAINED? -->

      <p>Your authorisation will be suspended if you do not maintain your qualification(s). Most OVs can do this by revalidating it every 4 years. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-top: 40px">Access to Sam if you will be TB testing</h3>

      <p>Sam is APHA's electronic system for recording bovine TB test results. All OVs who will be carrying out TB tests must <a href="sam">register on Sam</a>. The practice you test for must also be registered.</p>

      


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="ov-records" style="margin-top: 30px">Maintaining your OV records</h2>

      <p>APHA's OV team will create and update OV records for your practice, and ensure that all relevant documentation is issued.</p>

      <p>During your appointment, if you need to update your name or transfer to another practice, you must first update your Improve International account information.</p>

      <p>You must then complete either the OV57 form to change your name, or the OV58 practice form for a practice transfer.</p>

      <p>Send your form to APHA's OV team by post. Your information will be processed within 10 working days. Updated certificates can be found on Improve International.</p>




      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="lost-damaged-stolen-stamp">Get a replacement stamp</h3>

      <p>If your stamp has been lost or damaged, complete the OV45 form and send it to APHA's OV team by post. You will need a lost property number for a stamp that has been lost.</p>

      <p>If your stamp has been stolen you must report the theft and get a Crime Reference Number before contacting the OV team. </p>

      <p>The OV team will issue replacement stamps within 10 working days.</p>




      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="stop-being-ov">Deregister as an OV</h3>

      <p>If your OV status is no longer required, complete the OV55 form and send it to APHA's OV team. Your information will be processed within 10 working days.</p>

      <p>After you have deregistered as an OV your official stamp must be destroyed. You can post it to APHA's OV team to do this for you. If you want to destroy your stamp yourself, you must:</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Peel off the rubber containing the unique number.</li>
        <li>Cut the rubber off and dispose of the rubber and number separately.</li>
        <li>Take a picture of the destroyed stamp and email it to CSCOneHealthOVTeam@apha.gov.uk.</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- <p><i>What happens after OV55 has been processed</i></p> -->


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="new-practice">Setting up a new practice</h2>

      <p>New practices should <a href="ov-practice-forms">download and complete the new OV practice forms</a>, then return them to APHA by post. <!-- These include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Details of suppliers A/AP201</li>
        <li>General procedures for Official Veterinarians, His Majesty's customs and excise conditions on OV fees self-billing invoicing systems - OV10</li>
        <li>General procedures for Official Veterinarians, payment of OV fees OV09</li>
        <li>Confidentiality agreement</li>
      </ul> -->

      <p>If your practice will be TB testing you must also <a href="sam">register for Sam and complete the OVb37 declaration form</a>.</p>

      <p>After the forms have been returned your local APHA office may wish to inspect your practice. When it is confirmed that your practice can be set up, APHA's OV team will complete the set up process and notify you. The OV team will ensure that all OV records are created and updated, and that relevant documentation is sent out.</p>

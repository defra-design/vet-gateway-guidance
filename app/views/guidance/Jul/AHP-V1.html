      <!-- <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">CSO training</h3>
      <p>All CSOs must register with Improve International and complete the OCQ(AHP) - CSO qualification.</p> -->


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Getting authorised by APHA</h3>
      <p>When you have completed your qualification, Improve International will ask APHA's OV team to grant your AHP authorisation.</p>
      <p>To get authorised, you must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>hold a valid OCQ(AHP) - ATT or OCQ(AHP) - CSO certificate</li>
        <li>be regarded by the Agency as suitable for carrying out tasks on behalf of Ministers, taking into account any previous performance as an official</li>
      </ul>
      <p>ATTs must also:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>carry out the testing as part of a veterinary business under the supervision of an Approved Veterinary Supervisor (AVS) and one or 2 deputy AVS (AVSd)</li>
        <li><a href="">enrol in Sam</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Authorisation can take up to 10 working days. You'll be notified by email if you're successful. If you're a CSO, APHA will send your CSO stamp to your main practice address.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Maintaining your qualification and authorisation</h2>
      <p>AHP qualifications must be revalidated:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>for ATTs, 2 years after the initial authorisation and then every 4 years</li>
        <li>for CSOs, every 4 years</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your authorisation will be suspended if you do not maintain your qualification(s). Improve International will send you reminders of your revalidation deadline by email. If you do not revalidate by the deadline your authorisation will be suspended and you’ll have 6 months to revalidate it before it expires.</p>
      <p>If your authorisation expires you’ll need to complete your training again to reauthorise.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Extensions and exceptions</h3>
      <p>You can apply for an extension or exception if you cannot complete:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the OCQ(AHP) revalidation within the deadline</li>
        <li>the OCQ(AHP) - ATT training requirements within the period of conditional authorisation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Extensions and exceptions can only be considered in certain situations. Details can be found in the application form.</p>

      <p><a href="">Request extension or exception to OCQ training requirement (TR588)</a>.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Maintaining your AHP records</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for making sure all your details recorded on Improve International are correct.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need a replacement CSO stamp</h3>
      <p>If your CSO stamp has been lost, damaged or stolen you must complete the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ov45-get-a-new-official-veterinarian-ov-stamp">OV45 form</a> and send it to APHA’s OV team. The OV team will send you a replacement stamp within 10 working days of receiving the form.</p>
      <p>You’ll need a lost property number for a stamp that’s been lost.</p>
      <p>If your stamp has been stolen you must report the theft to the police. If you are given a crime reference number you must include it on the OV45 form.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're registered on Sam and need to change your name or transfer to another practice</h3>
      <p>To change your details on Sam you must first update your Improve International account information, and then complete:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ov57-change-your-name-on-sam">OV57 form for a name change</a>, or</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="stop-being-ov">How to stop being an AHP</h2>
      <p>You can either:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="">deregister as an AHP (form OV56)</a>, or</li>
        <li>allow your authorisation to expire by choosing not to revalidate your qualification(s)</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- <p>Deregistering as an OV will stop all official OV communications. If you do not deregister, official communications related to your qualifications will stop soon after your qualifications expire but you will continue to receive some OV briefing notes.</p> -->
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to destroy your official CSO stamp</h3>
      <p>When your authorisation ends you must destroy your official CSO stamp. You can do this yourself or post it to APHA’s OV team to do it for you. If you want to destroy your stamp yourself, you must:</p>
          <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Peel off the rubber containing the unique number.</li>
            <li>Cut the rubber off and dispose of the rubber and number separately.</li>
            <li>Take a picture of the destroyed stamp and email it to <a href="">CSCOneHealthOVTeam@apha.gov.uk</a>.</li>

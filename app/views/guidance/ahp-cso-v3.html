      <p>CSOs are non-veterinary personnel who are authorised by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) to support Certifying Officers for export health certification for animal products (excluding germplasm and live animals).</p>
      <p>They are also known as Animal Health Paraprofessionals (AHPs).</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        <p>All CSOs are authorised under the <a href="">Policy for APHA Authorisation of Export Certification Support Officers (CSOs) in Great Britain (ET175)</a>. You must be familiar with this document before becoming an ATT and while you are authorised.</p>
      </div>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Training and requirements</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Eligibility</h3>
      <p>To become a CSO you must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be over the age of 18</li>
        <li>have the right to work in the UK</li>
        <li>have a basic DBS check with no recorded convictions</li>
        <li>be proficient in English and able to communicate for the purposes of the role of an AHP</li>
        <li>have no known conflict of interest in the proposed work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You must also have at least 3 A levels, one of which must be in a science or food technology subject. Equivalent qualifications, such as Scottish Highers or non-UK qualifications, and all UK university degrees, are also eligible.</p>
      <p>If you do not have any of these qualifications, you may be able to <a href="">apply for CSO eligibility based on relevant experience (ET222)</a>.</p></li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Register with Improve International</h3>
      <p>To access the CSO training you must <a href="https://www.improve-ahp.com/registration/">register with Improve International</a> and then choose to do the OCQ(AHP) - CSO qualification.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Complete the ATT course and exam</h3>
      <p>All CSOs must complete an online course and pass the end of course exam. You will then be able to get authorised as a CSO by APHA.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Get authorised by APHA</h3>
      <p>When you have completed your qualification, Improve International will ask APHA's OV team to grant your full CSO authorisation.</p>
      <p>To get authorised, you must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be regarded by the Agency as suitable for carrying out tasks on behalf of Ministers, taking into account any previous performance as an official</li>
        <li>work under the direction of a Certifying Officer (CO) who is either an Official Veterinarian (OV) or Food Competent Certifying Officer (FCCO)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Authorisation can take up to 10 working days. If you're successful, you'll be notified by email and APHA will send your CSO stamp to your employer's address.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Maintaining your qualification and authorisation</h2>
      <p>Your OCQ(AHP) - CSO qualification must be revalidated every 4 years. Improve International will send you reminders of your revalidation deadline by email.</p>
      <p>Your authorisation will be suspended if you do not maintain your qualification(s). Improve International will send you reminders of your revalidation deadline by email. If you do not revalidate by the deadline your authorisation will be suspended and you’ll have 6 months to revalidate it before it expires.</p>
      <p>If your authorisation expires you’ll need to complete your training again to reauthorise.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Extensions and exceptions</h3>
      <p>You can apply for an extension or exception if you cannot complete the OCQ(AHP) revalidation within the deadline</p>
      <p>Extensions and exceptions can only be considered in certain situations. Details can be found in the application form.</p>

      <p><a href="">Request extension or exception to OCQ training requirement (TR588)</a>.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Maintaining your AHP records</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for making sure all your details recorded on Improve International are correct.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need a replacement CSO stamp</h3>
      <p>If your CSO stamp has been lost, damaged or stolen you must complete the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ov45-get-a-new-official-veterinarian-ov-stamp">OV45 form</a> and send it to APHA’s OV team. The OV team will send you a replacement stamp within 10 working days of receiving the form.</p>
      <p>You’ll need a lost property number for a stamp that’s been lost.</p>
      <p>If your stamp has been stolen you must report the theft to the police. If you are given a crime reference number you must include it on the OV45 form.</p>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="stop-being-ov">How to stop being a CSO</h2>
      <p>You can either:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="">deregister as an CSO (form OV56)</a>, or</li>
        <li>allow your authorisation to expire by choosing not to revalidate your qualification(s)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deregistering as aCSO  will stop all official CSO communications. If you do not deregister, official communications related to your qualifications will stop soon after your qualifications expire but you will continue to receive some CSO briefing notes.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to destroy your official CSO stamp</h3>
      <p>When your authorisation ends you must destroy your official CSO stamp. You can do this yourself or post it to APHA’s OV team to do it for you. If you want to destroy your stamp yourself, you must:</p>
          <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Peel off the rubber containing the unique number.</li>
            <li>Cut the rubber off and dispose of the rubber and number separately.</li>
            <li>Take a picture of the destroyed stamp and email it to <a href="">CSCOneHealthOVTeam@apha.gov.uk</a>.</li>
          </ol>
